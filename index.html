        <p><em>"What is ICT?"</em></p>
        <p>Information and Communications, or ICT in short, encompasses the fields of technology that serve as primary tools for collaborating in projects with apps that provide real-time collaborative document updates, and communication through digital messenging tools and apps, especially in today's world.</p>

       <h3 class="Topic-Box">Topic Overview</h3>
        <p>Like we've mentioned in the picture, our topic is about ICT being integrated into schools and classrooms, showcasing the rapid advancement of ICT in the recent years, as well as its adaptability to be used not only in offices, but also in every day life and even in classrooms as well. </p>
        <p>Now what does it mean when it "gives more people an advantage in the 21st century"? is it because of the convenience it gives, or the ease of usage, such as creating a bank account in a few clicks? well, it's a mix of both.</p>
        <p>ICT, like most things, evolve over time, from simple webpages with text to complex layouts and floating panels, it has come a long way from when it was first discovered and researched upon in 1997.</p>
